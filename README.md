### **Description**  
**Rock-Paper-Scissors** is a simple yet interactive game built using **C++**. The game allows the player to compete against the computer in the classic hand game, where each round results in a win, loss, or draw based on the chosen moves.  

Key features include:  

- **Turn-Based Mechanics** – The player selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer makes a random choice.  
- **Game Rules & Outcome Calculation** – Implemented logic follows the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules to determine the winner.  
- **Score Tracking** – The game keeps a running tally of player and computer wins across multiple rounds.  
- **Looped Gameplay** – Users can play multiple rounds until they choose to exit.  
- **Simple Console Interface** – Designed with clear text-based prompts for an intuitive user experience.  

The project was developed with **clean code principles**, making it **easily extendable** for future improvements, such as adding more game modes, AI-based strategies, or a graphical interface.

### **Technologies**  
The game was developed using a structured and efficient approach, incorporating:  

- **Programming Language**: C++ – Chosen for its efficiency, control, and structured game logic implementation.  
- **Development Environment**: Microsoft Visual Studio – Utilized for project management, debugging, and build optimization.  
- **Project Type**: Visual Studio C++ Project (.vcxproj) – Managed within a structured solution for maintainability.  
- **Randomization**: Implemented using **C++ standard library** functions to ensure unpredictable computer moves.
